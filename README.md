# Employee Management System using JDBC, Eclipse IDE, and DAO ORM

## Overview

This project is an Employee Management System designed to efficiently manage employee information through a Java-based application. The application utilizes JDBC for database connectivity, Eclipse IDE for development, and follows a structured architecture pattern using DAO (Data Access Object) and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) principles.

## Features

1. **Employee CRUD Operations:**
   - Create, Read, Update, and Delete employee records.
   - View a list of all employees.

2. **Database Connectivity:**
   - Utilizes JDBC for seamless communication with the underlying relational database.

3. **DAO Architecture:**
   - Implements the DAO design pattern to separate the data access logic from the business logic.
   - Ensures a clean and modular codebase, facilitating future modifications and enhancements.

4. **ORM Principles:**
   - Incorporates Object-Relational Mapping to bridge the gap between the object-oriented model and the relational database.
   - Enhances maintainability and reduces code complexity.

5. **User-friendly Interface:**
   - Simple and intuitive console-based interface for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The primary programming language for developing the application.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):** Enables interaction with the relational database.
- **Eclipse IDE:** Used for development, debugging, and project management.
- **DAO (Data Access Object):** Organizes data access logic and promotes separation of concerns.
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):** Simplifies the interaction between Java objects and the relational database.
